Reflection

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
(Answer) I achieved the main requirements of fetching the API and creating a gallery.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
(Answer) I was unable to achieve the mapping of key functions to scroll through the images (with the left and right buttons).

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
The process involved in mapping the keys and/or buttons, and how to incorporate them into the code. I feel once shown I will be fine. It's just the process I've never seen before and I found online help very confusing. Some people opt to using different imports from react, that we have yet to be shown.
